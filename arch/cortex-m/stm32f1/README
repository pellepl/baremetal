Makeflags:
  NO_STM32_LL_DRIVER
    By default, the STM32 LL driver is compiled and included. Define this not
    to include the LL driver files.

  NO_STM32_LL_DRIVER_FULL
    By defult, the above LL driver is compiled with flag USE_FULL_LL_DRIVER.
    Define this not to do this.

  CONFIG_UART_STM32_RX_INTERRUPT
    Define this to have uart rx interrupts, will be called back to
    uart_irq_rxchar_stm32f1 from interrupt context. A weak implementation
    doing nothing is default.

  NO_STM32_TEMPLATE_SYSTEM_FILE
    By default, the MDKs STM32F1xx/Source/Templates/system_stm32f1xx.c is
    included in source files for this family. Define this to avoid that and
    implement your own SystemInit function.

  CONFIG_STM32F1_HALT_USING_SYSCLK
    Use SYSCLK for calculating cycles to halt when calling cpu_halt(x)

See stm-flash.mk for convenience targets for flashing, debugging etc.
